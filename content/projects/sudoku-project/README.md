# Sudoku Project

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to solve sudokus through different approaches. The idea is to start from the most simple to the most complex algorithm and understand the idea behind each of them. 

## Game

[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) game is a **mathematical puzzle**. The goal is to fill all the blank spots with numbers from 0 to 9.

The board is a 9x9 grid, and there are different modalities with a different ruleset. The classical one has 3 main rules:

- No number can be repeated in a row
- No number can be repeated in a column
- No number can be repeated in each 3x3 grid

The board has some numbers already in it. Those are the initial hints that would help you solve the problem. The number of hints determines the difficulty level of the puzzle.
